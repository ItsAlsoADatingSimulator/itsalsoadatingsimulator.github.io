          <p>30th of April 2015</p>
          
         <p>Hello guys, Today i'm bringing some more news and requests to the /r/RWBY community.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what Project Date is, Look no further. I'll explain briefly. 
Project Date: Is a visual novel video game about dating and meeting people in the community of /r/rwby.
for more info please view the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/projectdate/">Subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>To get the most coverage please subscribe to that subreddit, and check out the official <a href="https://twitter.com/PJDOfficial">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://itsalsoadatingsimulator.github.io/">Website</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, Project Date officially went into production earlier this month. Time is flying by but the game is still quite far away. It's most likely going to take a few months. </p>

<p>To go along with that, we are entering a dark zone in the development. Updates are going to be less common due to the fact that we cant really release too much info without being spoiler-ish. But we still plan to keep you updated on what we can.</p>

<p>One reason for this is related to the fact we still need an artist for doing Background / Backdrop work. If you are interested. Post a comment or msg me and or the mods on PJD.</p>

<p>Also, I was wondering if you guys would be interested on maybe a Diary series. Or some form a video vlog from me, The dev. To go along with that I could do a Q@A or an AMA and answer some question you might have about PJD, or me. Please let me know in the comments if you are interested.</p>

<p>Also, We could use a Logo and maybe Graphics designer, MSG for more info on that. Music is also thing, If you can compose music, Feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>I think that's that it for now.

<p>OH, And also it's my birthday. So why not spend it working.</p>
